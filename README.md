# Alt

`alt` is a command line utility that attempts to find the "alternate path" for
the provided path. This is primarily intended for developers. It is written in
Rust. Hence, it is compiled and distributed as a binary.

It was originally written to alternate files in vim, but has no dependency on
vim at all and can be used in many other scenarios as it is just a command line
utility.

Its interface is as simple as they come.

* Pass it a path as the first argument
* It will print the alternate path to standard out

For example:

```text
$ alt spec/app/queues/fee/user_fee_submission_spec.rb
app/queues/fee/user_fee_submission.rb
```

For advanced usage, full reference of the command line interface, and frequently
asked questions please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/uptech/alt/wiki).

## Installation

To install on Mac OS X or (MacOS) we provide a [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) tap
which provides the `alt` formula. You can use it by doing the following:

#### Add the Tap

```
brew tap "uptech/homebrew-oss"
```

#### brew install

```
brew install uptech/oss/alt
```

If you are on a platform other than Mac OS X or (MacOS) you will have to build
your own version from source.

### Build from Source

If you are on another platform you will have to build from source. Given
that `alt` is managed via Rust's Cargo. It can build as follows:

```
$ cargo build --release
```

Once you have built it successfully you should relocate the
`target/release/alt` binary to a location that exists in your `PATH` so
that you can easily use it.

*Note:* The above requires of course that you have [rust](http://rust-lang.org)
and Cargo.

## Use with Vim

There's no vim plugin. It may not end up needing one; we'll see. For now, you
can just stick the code below in your `.vimrc` to invoke `alt` with `<leader>.`.
**Note** that `alt` and the Vim Script example below **work** in both the
terminal based Vim and GUI based Vim like MacVim.

```vimscript
" Run a given vim command on the results of alt from a given path.
" See usage below.
function! AltCommand(path, vim_command)
  let l:alternate = system("alt " . a:path)
  if empty(l:alternate)
    echo "No alternate file for " . a:path . " exists!"
  else
    exec a:vim_command . " " . l:alternate
  endif
endfunction

" Find the alternate file for the current path and open it
nnoremap <leader>. :w<cr>:call AltCommand(expand('%'), ':e')<cr>
```
