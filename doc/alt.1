.TH ALT 1
.SH NAME
alt \- find the "alternate path" for the given path
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B alt
[OPTIONS] PATH
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B alt
finds the alternate file for the given PATH based on similarity ranking. For example, if you were in a Ruby project and ran
.B alt
.IR spec/app/queues/fee/user_fee_submission_spec.rb
it would output
.IR app/queues/fee/user_fee_submission.rb.
In this case the alternate for the test file is the implementation file.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-version
Output the version of \fBalt\fR
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Output the usage help
.TP
.BR \-a
Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot
.TP
.BR "\fB\-f\fR \fIfile\fR, \fB\-\-file\fR \fIfile\fR"
Read possible alternates from a \fIfile\fR rather than using the default
directory walk technique built into \fBalt\fR. If \fIfile\fR is "-" it will read
the possible alternates from \fIstdin\fR. The following is an example of using
find, a very common command line utility, to produce a filtered set of paths and
pass them to \fBalt\fR:

    find . -path tags -prune -or -path ./log -prune -or -type f -print | alt -f - spec/lib/foo/api_spec.rb

In the above example it excludes tags and log file paths from the possible
alternate paths and passes the rest into \fBalt\fR. \fBNote:\fR This example is
less performant than the built in directory walk technique and it's filtering.
It is simply an example of how you can pass output from one command line tool to
alt as input.
.SH USE WITH VIM
There's no vim plugin. It may not end up needing one; we'll see. For now, you
can just stick the code below in your \fI.vimrc\fR to invoke \fBalt\fR with
\fI<leader>\fR. Note that \fBalt\fR and the Vim Script example below work in
both the terminal based Vim and GUI based Vim like MacVim.

    " Run a given vim command on the results of alt from a given path.
    " See usage below.
    function! AltCommand(path, vim_command)
      let l:alternate = system("alt " . a:path)
      if empty(l:alternate)
        echo "No alternate file for " . a:path . " exists!"
      else
        exec a:vim_command . " " . l:alternate
      endif
    endfunction

    " Find the alternate file for the current path and open it
    nnoremap <leader>. :w<cr>:call AltCommand(expand('%'), ':e')<cr>

.SH IGNORING THINGS
\fBalt\fR by default ignores hidden directory entries, globs defined in a
\fB.ignore\fR file and globs defined in your project's \fB.gitignore\fR and your
global \fB.gitignore\fR. It does this because in our experience that is
generally the behavior you want. If however you want for example to be able to
alternate between hidden files for some reason, you can always use the \-a
option. If you want to have \fBalt\fR ignore some specific paths/files that you
don't want Git to ignore. You can simply define them in the \fB.ignore\fR file
at the root of your project.
